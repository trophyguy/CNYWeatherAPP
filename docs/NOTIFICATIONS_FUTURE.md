# Weather App Notifications - Future Implementation

## Current Status
Notifications have been temporarily disabled due to compatibility issues with the Flutter build system and Android Gradle plugin versions.

## Issues Encountered
1. Multiple initialization points for notifications across different files
2. Inconsistent channel IDs being used
3. Compatibility issues between Flutter packages and Android Gradle plugin versions
4. Build system errors related to package namespaces in Android manifests

## Required Changes for Future Implementation
1. Consolidate notification initialization into a single service
2. Standardize notification channel IDs
3. Update Android manifest with proper permissions:
   - `android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`
   - `android.permission.VIBRATE`
   - `android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`
   - `android.permission.USE_EXACT_ALARM`
   - `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS`
4. Add boot receiver for scheduled notifications
5. Ensure compatibility between:
   - Flutter version
   - Android Gradle plugin version
   - Gradle wrapper version
   - Java version
   - Flutter packages versions

## Implementation Plan
1. Research and select a stable combination of versions for all dependencies
2. Implement consolidated notification service
3. Add proper Android manifest configurations
4. Test notification functionality thoroughly
5. Document the implementation for future maintenance

## Notes
- Current Flutter version: 3.29.3
- Current Java version: OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.6)
- Issues were encountered with Android Gradle plugin 8.2.0 and Gradle 8.9
- Consider testing with Android Gradle plugin 7.3.0 and Gradle 7.5 for better compatibility
